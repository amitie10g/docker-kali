# Kali Linux plus Kalitorify on Docker image (WIP)
This is a somewhat customised set of Docker images of Kali Linux, for both platforms ``amd64`` (Docker Desktop on Windows, cloud, etc.) and ``arm64`` (Raspberry Pi, Apple Silicon Mac, etc.), and two flavors, [``kali-rolling``](https://hub.docker.com/r/amitie10g/kali-rolling) (``kali`` is the same image) and [``kali-bleeding-edge``](https://hub.docker.com/r/amitie10g/kali-bleeding-edge). Out-of-the-box tools for all needs!

Images are pushed weekly, monday at 12:00 UTC, leaving a margin for pushing images from upstream and update to the apt repository.

## Usage

* Just download ``docker-compose.yml``, place at an empty directory, and run ``docker-compose up -d``. This will start the ``latest`` and ``labs`` containers (if you use Windows, be sure to use another RDP port like 13389 to avoid conflicts with the local RDP port).

* Access the shell: ``docker exec -it --user kali desktop bash`` (omit ``--user kali`` to acces as root).

* Connect to the desktop environment using your Remote Desktop client. Available users are ``root`` and ``kali`` (password is ``kali`` for both). Just use ``root`` username.

* Inside the Desktop environment, browse the vulnerable webapps at the Vulnerable container:
  * http://vulnerable:42000 OWASP Juice Shop.
  * http://vulnerable:42001 Damn Vulnerable Web Application.

  Or use the tools available to attemp to exploit those web apps.

**Note**: Due to limitations related to file permissions on mounted volumes on **rootless Podman**, you need to connect to the instance (via console or RDP) using the ``root`` account.

## Building
The image depends on a Kali Linux base image built using the instructions on the [Phusion's base image](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker) repo. Use the ``latest`` tag when building larger images on your Dockerfile.
```
FROM ghcr.io/amitie10g/kali-rolling:latest
RUN apt-get install -y kali-tools-large && apt-get clean && rm -rf /tmp/* /var/tmp/* /var/lib/apt/lists/*
COPY init/ /etc/my_init.d/
WORKDIR /root
```

Then, run:

```
docker build --build-arg -t kali-linux:large .
```

Where build arg,
* ``KALI_VER`` The kali edition: ``rolling``, ``bleeding-edge``, ``last-release`` or ``experimental`` (if unsure, choose ``rolling``)
* ``TOOL`` One of the [packages](https://www.kali.org/tools/kali-meta/) starting with ``kali-tools-``
* ``--target`` The desired target:
  * ``base`` Just the base image
  * ``desktop`` The Desktop (XFCE, without tools) image
  * ``desktop-top10`` The desktop experience plus the top 10 tools
  * ``labs`` The vulnerable webapps
  * ``headless`` The cli-only tools
  * ``nethunter`` The Kali Nethunter system
  * ``tool`` The target for build the desired tool
 
Edit the Dockerfile to fit your needs.

## FAQ
* Q: Why you created this project<br>
  A: I'm preparing for diploma in cybersecurity, and as my hobby is create Docker containers, I created this as part of my tasks. As this will be useful for everyone, I'be compromised to maintain this project.

* Q: Why s6-overlay<br>
  A: Because this eases the process of bringing required services for tools (eg. Postgres for Metasploit).

* Q: Why XRDP instead o VNC?<br>
  A: a) most of the users uses Windows, and the Remote Desktop client is integrated, and runs seamlessly; and b) performance.
